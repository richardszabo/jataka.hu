Background creation
-------------------

Unfortunately, I do not remember well:
- Script-fu/Decor/Old photo with default parameters,
- Script-fu/Alchemy/Clothify,
- and something to make he result lighter and yellower.

Text on the background
----------------------

- Use the already created back.tif,
- Use Charter font with 25 pixels,
- Script-fu/Shadow/Drop-shadow,
- Crop back to its original size,
- Layers/Anchor layers,
- Layers/Merge visible layers with clipped to image,
- save with 100% quality.
