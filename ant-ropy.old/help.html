    <h1>Playground for ants - what is this?</h1>
<p>
    It is an ant simulation aimed at investigating their foraging behavior.
    When ants - small red discs with a line heading marker -
    swarm out of their nest they appear to wander randomly at first,
    but soon they form a well-pronounced trail between the nest - blue disc - and the food source -
    a bunch of green dots in a neighbourhood.
    Surprisingly, the trail found is typically fairly close to the shortest possible path.
    When there are multiple food sources, the ant colony usually exploits them
    in the order of their distance.
</p>
<p>
    Individual ants wander out of the nest in random directions, leaving a trail of ‘homing pheromone’
    (a volatile chemical substance) - blue cloud - behind.
    When an ant finds food, it sets out for the nest, this time dropping ‘food pheromone’ - green cloud - as it goes.
    Food-seeking ants follow the gradient of ‘food pheromone’ in their local neighborhood,
    while homing ants seek places with high amounts of ‘homing pheromone’.
    Below a certain threshold pheromone level and also with a constant probability, the ants move randomly.
    This latter component controls the balance between ‘exploitation’ and ‘exploration’, the essence of optimizing behavior.
</p>
<p>
    During their walk, ants follow a simple probabilistic rule:
    they move to the neighboring cell with the highest pheromone level
    (depending on their destination, they either seek ‘homing pheromone’ or
    ‘food pheromone’ locations). Below a certain threshold, and with a given
    probability, they move randomly. However, the ants prefer not to turn, i.e.,
    their selection of new location is biased by their direction.
</p>
<p>
    The simulation has some parameters that can be altered by you:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Seed: randomization value. The same seed with other parameters unchanged always shows the same colony behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
            Food sources: the number of location around which food particles are scattered with a Gaussan distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
            Food: Number of food particles in all food sources.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ants: Number of foraging ants.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The results table shows the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Step: Elapsed time since the start of the simulation in discrete units.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ants carrying: Number of ants possessing a food particle and carrying it to the hive.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ants searching: Number of ants without food searching for a particle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Food collected: Number of food particles collected so far.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step cycle: current speed of the simulation in milliseconds.
            Be careful and do not use too large parameters to keep the simulation responsive.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    If you click on an ant then it becomes the selected ant - highlighted in yellow -
    and you will see its actual state in the table on the Selected ant tab.
</p>
<p>
    Entropy tab shows the development of the ant and the food entropy over time.

    You can watch the on-going simulation by clicking on Run or follow it step by step clicking on Step.
